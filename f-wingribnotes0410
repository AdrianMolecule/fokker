Folker DRI Triplane - Wing Ribs Section

On the assumption we are going ahead with this project: Please locate drawings FK-WINGXSECTION.ODG and .PDF

We'll need 2 masters and 50+ roughs of these ribs,  so if you wish to join the party:

NOTE: the masters will make a router jig and a marking/drilling template.

      This makes V1. V2 has an inside butty on the two spars, V3 seats the aileron on the upper wings.

0. Please elect a Fokker Wing Coordinator!

1. Print out one of the drawings and check the dimensions for accuracy.  (My HP shows 2mm error, the Brothers is dead on)

2 Fold the sheet horizontally and tear in two.

3 Cut out the SMALL 1/2" square in the AFT section.

4 Lay the aft section over the fwd section with the 1/2" squares aligned.

5 Align the horizontal lines with a rule and align the vertical lines through the 1/2" square.

6 Carefully tape the two pieces together, front and back, to make a rib template.


7 Prepare a smooth & straight piece of wood approx 17.5 x 3 x 3/8", (we don't need pretty, cracked or big knots)

8 Glue the template to the wood. (Leading and trailing edge blocks will overlap the ends)

9 Accurately centre punch the fwd alignment hole.

10 Roughly cut out the template leaving 1/8" outside clearance.

11 Initial the back of the wood, notify the 'Wing Coordinator, and STOP.
